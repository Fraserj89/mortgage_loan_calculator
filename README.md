# mortgage_loan_calculator
This is my first attempt at a simple mortgage/loan calculator

I have built this is my first project for github.

Hopefully the main script is commented well enough to be able  explain my methodology.
I have also used camelcase, which was drilled in from C# so apologies if this is not the right way for python.

I hope this can help and guide others, I have found this to be a good project to learn from.
